# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-in-C

In this project my goal was to make a Tic Tac Toe game in C, after taking a one semester course "Introduction to programming" where we learned the basics of C programming logic, logic that comes with it and dynamic structures in programming. I hope you will find this project helpful!

# How does this game work?

This game is quite simple, it involves a matrix that is being filled with X's and O's. The player (he is predefined with an X) plays first, and computer plays after the player does, the computer moves are generated as a remainder of deviding a random number by 3.
