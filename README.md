# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-in-C
In this project my goal was to make a Tic Tac Toe game in C, after taking a one semester course "Introduction to programming" where we learned the basics of C programming logic, logic that comes with it and dynamic structures in programming. I hope you will find this project helpful!
